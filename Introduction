**QUICK SUMMARY**

The speed of development is one of its major advantages. If you want to develop an application or a website promptly, it is imperative to consider using Bootstrap. It helps to save your coding effort by offering less CSS functionality and pre-built blocks of code rather than structuring code from the scratch.This article aims to help you avoid mistakes and assist you with building your own User Input Form.

IF YOU SEARCH FOR HOW TO CREATE USER INPUT FORM USING jQuery AND BOOTSTRAP,YOU WILL come across many different approaches and libraries.HTML,CSS-in-JS libraries,Validation using Bootstrap Validators.You come across all of these in articles and blogs, tutorials.

How do we choose between them? Why do so many approaches exist in the first place? If you’re already comfortable with one method, why even consider moving to another?

In this article, I’m going to take a look at the code I have used for creating registration form using Bootstrap and validating it using jQuery. I’ve worked on, comparing features from what I’ve actually encountered rather than summarizing the content.We will have a look at bootstrap forms also have a look at not just how we style forms in a beautiful way like this but also how we validate them and make sure that we provide good user feedback to ensure our users can really work with our forms in the way we want them to work with.

> Getting Started
This tutorial was created from a programmer’s perspective and If you have atleast some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS,It should help you get started with creating, organizing and maintaining a user registration form.

> Requirements
Before starting, there are some requirements that we have to cover to define the code using Bootstrap and validating it.

> Creating Registration form using Bootstrap
Now we're going to create a Bootstrap template of User Registration Form by including the HTML,Bootstrap CSS and JS files, as well as other JavaScript dependencies like jQuery.

> How do we add forms ?
It's actually pretty straight forward first of all we add the form element not strictly required for bootstrap but semantically it makes sense to create a HTML form I guess and in there a typical form obviously has some inputs.let's say we add an input element type text and we could give that some name like maybe user name whatever you want to fetch eventually with that input and we could have another input maybe off type password and we could well fetch the user password so this would be like a typical standard form.
